# Project Name Undecided


## Project Description
Provides an easy to use marketplace for the trade and resale of UF Football Tickets, which currently is only done through group messaging apps.  Users are able to post their tickets for sale, as well as look for tickets for their desired games.  Project will potentially include an escrow system, which would protect both the buyer and seller by holding both the ticket and the payment until both are made.  Further research is required on the ease of implementing a payment system as well as the process of automated transferring of the ticket.  Otherwise, the website will simply serve as a central location for buying and selling tickets, with payment done outside the site.
