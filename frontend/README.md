# Photo Bomb

## Project Description
Through the use of image steganography, our website will allow users to hide text in their photos. Users will be able to create their own accounts where they upload images and write hidden messages which can serve the purpose of keeping diary or journal entries private, hiding information from plain sight, and creating hidden watermarks. Features will include users being able to share images and create passwords to better hide their secret messages.
